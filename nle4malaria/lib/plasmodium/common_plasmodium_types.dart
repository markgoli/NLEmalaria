It is distinguished by its ability to cause severe blood vessel blockages and complications such as cerebral malaria. Structurally, the parasite demonstrates a complex life cycle involving several stages: sporozoites, merozoites, and gametocytes. The merozoites of P. falciparum are capable of infecting a larger proportion of red blood cells, including those of varying ages, which contributes to its virulence. Its gametocytes are crescent-shaped, facilitating easier identification under a microscope.'),

This parasite causes quartan malaria, named for the fever spikes occurring every third day (a 72-hour cycle). The trophozoites and schizonts of P. malariae appear more compact and less amoeboid compared to those of other species. One of the defining structural features of P. malariae is the band-form trophozoites, where the parasite forms a band across the infected red blood cell."),

P. vivax is notorious for its ability to cause relapses by remaining dormant in the liver for months or even years. From a structural viewpoint, P. vivax infects only young red blood cells or reticulocytes. It is characterized by large, irregularly shaped trophozoites and schizonts that distort the host cell, making it larger and stippled with Sch√ºffner's dots visible under staining."),

This species is less common and tends to be geographically restricted to West Africa and certain islands in the western Pacific. Structurally, P. ovale resembles P. vivax with its large, oval-shaped schizonts and gametocytes.
